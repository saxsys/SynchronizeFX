/**
 * <p>
 * This is the interface to the underlying network library that serializes and transfers the messages produced by
 * this framework.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * All methods defined in here are intended to be used by {@link SynchronizeFxClient} and not by the user.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Any implementation must be capable of transferring all classes in the package
 * {@link de.saxsys.synchronizefx.core.metamodel.commands}, the class {@code java.util.UUID} and all classes of the
 * user domain model that doesn't contain any Fields that extend {@link Property}. You may wan't the user to provide
 * them manually if your implementation hasn't any generic system to handle any {@link Object} that is thrown on it.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * It is guaranteed that {@link MessageTransferServer#setTopologyCallback(NetworkToTopologyCallbackServer)} is only
 * called before {@link MessageTransferServer#start()} and the send methods only after
 * {@link MessageTransferServer#start()} (maybe multiple times). It is also guaranteed that no more methods are
 * called after {@link MessageTransferServer#shutdown()} was called.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * If you support user supplied serializers, please use the {@link Serializer} interface for them. This way
 * serializers are usable for multiple {@link MessageTransferServer} implementations.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This is the server side. For the client side see {@link NetworkLayerCallbackClient}.
