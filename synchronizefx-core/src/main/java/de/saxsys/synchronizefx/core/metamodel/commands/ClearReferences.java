 * Tells the other side, that hard references that where created during the assembling of the objects can now be
 * deleted.
 * 
 * The commands to create the values of {@link Property} fields in domain object are in some cases send before the
 * command to create the domain object. Until the values are attached to the domain object there would normally only
 * weak references to these values which could mean that they are already garbage collected before they are attached to
 * the domain obejct. To prevent this all created object are put into a set to have a hard reference. To prevent memory
 * leaks this set has to be emptied to make the objects garbage collectible when they are no longer used by the user.
 * This is done by this command.
